##-----------**Introduction**-----------##

Spiders, belonging to the order *Araneae*, are an interesting taxonomic group due to their abundance in most residential areas in Canada. They play an important role in controlling the population of insects, akin to natural pest control agents (Hesselberg et al., 2023). They are widespread across diverse environments, ranging from temperate to tropical regions. One interesting hypothesis is that *Araneae* in temperate regions, such as Canada, show a larger geographic range compared to those in tropical regions, like India. This hypothesis is on the basis that temperate regions have greater environmental variability, which forces the species to adapt to a wider range of conditions, which in turn increase their geographic distribution. 

Previous studies have stated that species in variable climates likely portray larger ecological tolerances and, thus, wider geographic ranges (Stevens, 1989). On the other hand, tropical regions usually have a more consistent environment, allowing species to adapt to more specific ecological conditions (Brown et al., 1996). To test this hypothesis, data was obtained from the Barcode of Life Data System (BOLD), which is a database for DNA-based species identification and biodiversity research (Ratnasingham & Hebert, 2007). DNA barcoding, which involves sequencing a standardized region of DNA, is a reliable method to help identify species and their genetic diversity (Hebert et al., 2003). This assignment compares the latitudinal ranges of *Araneae* BINs (Barcode Index Numbers) in Canada and India using BOLD data.

##------**Results and Discussions**------##

The results from the three figures show strong support for the hypothesis that spiders in temperate regions, such as Canada, have larger geographic ranges compared to those in tropical regions, like India. In Figure 1, the map displays the geographic distribution of Araneae BINs, showing that BINs in Canada are spread over a much wider geographic area compared to those in India, where the distribution is more concentrated. In Figure 2, the violin plot shows the spread of latitudinal ranges in both regions. Although India has a wider center in the 0–5 degree range, indicating more concentration of its BINs in that range relative to its total BINs, Canada’s BINs demonstrate a much larger overall spread, with several outliers extending beyond 20 degrees. Finally, in Figure 3, the PCA plot further outlines the differences between these two regions by showing that Canadian BINs show greater variability across the first two principal components, while Indian BINs are grouped together more tightly. The spread in Canada’s data implies a wider range of geographic variation, both in latitude and longitude.


These patterns shown in the figures align with the hypothesis. The wider geographic ranges in Canada could be explained by the greater environmental variability in temperate regions, which forces species to adapt to a broader range of conditions. By comparison, the narrower geographic ranges in India reflect the stability of tropical environments, where species adapt to more specific ecological conditions (Brown et al., 1996). However, one potential source of discrepancy that could account for an incorrect hypothesis is the limited number of BINs sampled from India. It is possible that insufficient sampling efforts in India may have led to an under representation of Araneae species, skewing the results. To increase the scope of testing this hypothesis in future research, one could explore whether these patterns exist across other taxonomic groups that are equally represented, or include more countries from both temperate and tropical regions. In doing so, it can potentially lead to broader understanding of how environmental variability affects species distributions on a larger scale.

I would also like to acknowledge the use of ChatGPT in helping me understand and use the PCA analysis in R. Even after consulting manuals and tutorials, I found it difficult to understand and apply PCA to my specific dataset and hypothesis. ChatGPT provided the guidance I needed to perform the PCA correctly.
